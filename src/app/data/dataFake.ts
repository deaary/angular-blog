She wields a unique weapon called the blaster edge in battle, a bladed projectile she launches from a firing mechanism on her left arm; after hitting the target, the projectile returns to Rinoa like a boomerang.

Apart from the angel wings symbolism and her ring, shooting stars have a significance to Rinoa. She points at a shooting star during her introductory scene, her most potent weapon is Shooting Star, and her ultimate Limit Breaks is called Wishing Star.",
